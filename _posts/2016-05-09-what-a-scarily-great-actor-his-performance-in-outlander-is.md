title: "What a scarily great actor, his performance in Outlander is truly amazing. Portraying two people, each at one end of the spectrum, it's as if you are looking at a different person who just happens to have the same face - precisely as it should be. Jack and Frank Randall were two men who lived in different times, 200 years apart. What a beautiful performance."

# What a scarily great actor, his performance in Outlander is truly amazing. Portraying two people, each at one end of the spectrum, it's as if you are looking at a different person who just happens to have the same face - precisely as it should be. Jack and Frank Randall were two men who lived in different times, 200 years apart. What a beautiful performance.
